Lab 3: Soror

Intent - Our intent was to create a fun 2D platformer with some mechanics familiar to games we have played ourselves.

Mechanics - The mechanics in our game included basic movement, jumping, one-way platforms, spikes that would kill the player, checkpoints, double-jumping, and dashing. 

Aesthetics - We shot for a more mysterious and dark atmosphere. We wanted to blend a dark woods environment with old ruins to sell a feeling of a mysterious and slightly spooky medieval setting. Though we had this mysterious and spooky tone, we also wanted to include bits of beauty with the trees.

Joys - Designing small platforming challenges with the tile palette was enjoyable since it allowed us to indulge in our creativity and manipulation of the mechanics we designed. Though often they were difficult to make, getting familiar platforming mechanics to work exactly how we wanted was immensely satisfying. Being able to make something that resembles a game that someone would actually want to play was also satisfying. Slowly seeing the progression from a blue screen to a cohesive gaming experience was and always is an absolute joy. 

Struggles - Getting the mechanics to work exactly as we envisioned was immensely difficult; often the mechanics would work, but not exactly how we wanted them to, which would force us to tweak or scrap the idea and start again. Getting the parallax background to cooperate on any of the levels was consistently a pain. For some reason, the collision between the player and the ground was constantly an issue with the player getting caught on nothing. Working between scenes became a real pain as object would struggle to communicate properly with the game manager. It proved to be much more important to do as much as possible outside the game manager, and have pieces within the scenes communicate among themselves independently as much as possible.

Contributions of Group Members - Josh Thomeczek handled much of the backbone that allowed our project to function as a game. Namely, this included handling much of the code in the GameManager that involved spawning the player, moving the game between scenes, and showing dialogue to the player. Additionally, Josh handled many of the aesthetic and narrative touches present in the game. This included writing the dialogue, handling the parallax background, designing and scripting the Main Menu, bringing in sounds and music, and incorporating one of the two tilesets chiefly utilized in the project. Morgan McLeod handled the scripting for the platforming mechanics listed above in the Mechanics section. Most of his work done for the project was in service of getting these mechanics to function exactly as intended and to make them feel good to the player. Additionally, Morgan handled all of the animations utilized by the player's character. Both Josh and Morgan worked on designing the levels of the game with Josh designing levels 1 and 2, and Morgan designing level 3. There was not a tangible shred of contribution from Mars Paton other than a suggestion for the name.
